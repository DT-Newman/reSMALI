# reSMALI
scoring matrix-assisted ligand identification (SMALI) reborn

A tool for predicting SH2 domain binding from peptides with the sequence xx-Y-xxxx

SMALI was orignally described in Huang H, Li L, Wu C, et al. Defining the specificity space of the human SRC homology 2 domain. Mol Cell Proteomics. 2008;7(4):768-784. doi:10.1074/mcp.M700312-MCP200 . However the tool is no longer hosted.

The original OPAL arrays upon which the original SMALI tool were not published and are not publ. However normalised intensinty values making up 20% or more of the total intensity for a given position were published.
